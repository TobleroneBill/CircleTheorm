Theorem: Angle opposite the diameter is always a right angle
This real time calculates the angle at the position of  a point on the circumference.  It basically proves the point is always a right angle from the diameter. We use some more deeper math formulas - Law of cosines - since we have all the sides stored in memory, we just need to rearrange the formula, which comes out as:

c = cos-1(a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / 2*(a*b)

I want to make a video on it, but its kind of basic in terms of math stuff. Apparently you learn this in GCSE, but this fact never stuck with me so IDK. Maybe its not useful like pythagoras lol

I think I kind of want to make a collection of tiny visualisations of math concepts, since they are fun to do.
